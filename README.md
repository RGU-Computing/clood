# What is Clood? 
*(its **Cloud** in Scottish dialect)*


Case-based Reasoning (CBR) applications have been widely deployed across various sectors, including pharmaceuticals, defense, aerospace, IoT, transportation, poetry, and music generation. However, a significant proportion of these applications have been developed using monolithic architectures, which present size and complexity constraints. Consequently, these applications face barriers to the adoption of new technologies, and changes in frameworks or languages directly impact them, making them prohibitively expensive in terms of time and cost. To tackle this challenge, **we have developed Clood CBR, a distributed and highly scalable generic CBR system based on a microservices architecture.** By splitting the application into smaller, interconnected services, Clood CBR can scale to meet varying demands. Microservices are cloud-native architectures that have become increasingly popular with the rapid adoption of cloud computing. Therefore, the CBR community can benefit from a framework such as Clood CBR at this opportune time.

## Start Using Clood? üöÄ

### Local Development

We have simplified the entire CloodCBR development environment. You can easily start developing Clood CBR using the containarised environment now. Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)  installed.

Once cloned this repo you just have to run the following commands
1. Clone/Download the repo
2. Build the docker image and run

#### Minimal Stack

```
docker compose --env-file .env.dev up --build
```
_Does not include support for Semantic USE, Semantic SBERT, AnglE and Ontology similarities._

#### Full Stack
```
docker compose --profile other --env-file .env.dev up --build
```

* Please note that the docker build might take a bit longer depending on the internet speed (10-20mins)
* The above command uses default configuration from .env.dev, when moving to proudction make sure to change config files inside ```api/config.py```, ```dashboard/app/env.js``` and other services (if using them).

3. Open Clood CBR dashboard at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) using default username and password (```clood:clood```)

4. Start Using! Create a new project, configure, load and query cases.

## Project Components

### Implementation Architecture
üöß We are currently improving this section

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RGU-Computing/clood/master/images/clood_architecture.jpg">

## Clood Structure and Technologies
- Serverless Functions - REST API for communication from client apps (Serverless Framework with Python functions)
- Client - This is the demonstration dashboard (AngularJS)
- Elasticsearch - Managed ES service used as casebase 

### Serverless Functions

Project is available in the ```serverless-functions``` folder of the repository.

### Elasticsearch
For the Clood implementation we have used [AWS Elasticsearch service](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/).

### API endpoints

End-point | Request Method | Description
--- | --- | ---
/project | HTTP GET | Retrieves all the CBR projects
/project/{id} | HTTP GET | Retrieves a specific CBR project with specified id
/project | HTTP POST | Creates a new CBR project. The details of the project are included as a JSON object in the request body
/project/{id} | HTTP PUT | Updates the details of a CBR project. Modifications are included as a JSON object in the request body
/project/{id} | HTTP DELETE | Removes a CBR project with specified id
/case/{id}/list | HTTP POST | Bulk addition of cases to the casebase of the project with specified id. Cases are included in the request body as an array of objects
/retrieve | HTTP POST | Performs the case retrieve task
/retain | HTTP POST | Performs the case retain task
/config | HTTP GET | Retrieves the system configuration
/config | HTTP POST | Adds or updates the system configuration

üöß We are currently improving this section

### Client Dashboard

The Client Dashboard demonstrates the use of Clood through API calls to create and configure projects and perform CBR tasks. Project is available in the ```dashboard``` folder of the repository. The readme at ```dashboard``` describes how to instal the client dashboard.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RGU-Computing/clood/master/images/screenshots/client_projects.png">

Guide to install and use the Clood Dashboard is available in the /dashboard folder. [Clood Dashboard](https://github.com/RGU-Computing/clood/tree/master/dashboard)

üöß We are currently improving this section


### Deployment Guide
### OpenSearch (Formerly ElasticSearch in AWS) 
Follow the guide [Here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/es-createupdatedomains.html) on getting started with Elasticsearch in AWS. All you need next is the ES url and the AWS access keys.

### Serverless functions (API)

We have built Clood with the [serverless](https://serverless.com/) framework which is a used deploy and test serverless apps across different cloud providers. The example installation here will be for AWS.

1. Make sure you have installed and setup serverless framework globally. [Guide](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/)

2. Install Dependenices from CLI
```
npm install
```

3. Update the serverless.yml file as required. (Eg. region, service name..)

4. Add a conf.py file with the following structure

```python
aws = {
    "host": 'CLOUDSEARCH AWS URL', # domain.eu-west-1.es.amazonaws.com
    "region": 'eu-west-1',
    "access_key":   '',
    "secret_key": ''
}
```

4. Simply deploy now, it will package and run in CLI
```
serverless deploy
```

* Make sure that [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is running in your computer when deploying (it is required to package the python dependencies)
